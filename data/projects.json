        "requirements": "For this the project, you will design, model, texture, animate, and render a **30 second animation** solving for the project theme. Once you have a project idea and storyboard created, locate sound that you find on the audio resources tab that is licensed for remix (CC or Public Domain). Pay special attention to the **[audio track’s licensing](http://freemusicarchive.org/curator/Video/blog/Not_All_Music_on_FMA_is_Licensed_for_Video)**. You cannot use anything that states no derivatives, indicated by “ND” in the license. If the license requires you to give credit (CC-BY), you can give credit in the Vimeo.com description (where you will be uploading your video). You are encouraged to edit, modify, and combine different audio tracks to suit the needs of your animation.\n<br><br>\n**The video should contain 30 seconds of animation ±5 seconds.** While this may not seem like a very long time for an animation, it’s actually quite a lot of work to make 30 well crafted and polished seconds in terms of animation, modeling and materials, and rendering quality.\n<br><br>\nYou will also critically reflect on your work and the project theme in a 150 word work statement.\n<br><br>\nA successful project will demonstrate understanding and mastery of 3D tools and processes, application of **[formal design principles](https://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/principles_design.pdf)**, attention to detail and composition, and lead to discussion about your work during a critique.\n<br><br>\n## Project Theme\nWhat will you make an animation about? What makes your animation interesting? Go through the concept development process to identify a theme for this project. A theme can be as simple as a single word or complex stories derived from personal experiences. Try to identify the most simple version of the story you are trying to tell.\n<br><br>\n## Project format\nChoose a format that you can reasonable accomplish within the timeframe of the project. Examples include:\n- Narrative short film\n- Motion graphics \n    - branding and identity\n    - Product\n    - Explainer animation\n    - VJ loops for live performances\n    - Experimental or non-narrative content: [Examples on vimeo.com](https://vimeo.com/categories/experimental)\n    - Scientific or data-driven simulations and visualizations\n- VFX/CFX Breakdown Reel\n<br><br>\n\n## Constraints\nDo not produce work that could be construed as ‘fan art’ for existing intellectual properties. All assets used in the production of the work must be created by you, be appropriately licensed for use, or be appropriated in a transformative way that significantly alters the nature of the original asset. For example, you can use a texture pack you downloaded from a texture website, however, if you render an image of just a flat plane with the texture applied, this is not really creative transformation since the entirety of the image is work from someone else. Your transformation and contextualization is what’s important. A render with a background that uses an image from Google image search (please don’t do this) that comprises more than 50% of the work is also not really enough creative transformation. If someone reviews your work and says that the image’s background is their favorite part of the image, you’ll have to then explain how you didn’t make the background, which is not a great situation to be in.\n",

        "description": "For this project, you will produce 3D rendered images of products and other objects you experience every day, but with one slight difference. You will augment the object in such a way to inhibit its utility, material qualities, or its system or environmental context.\n<br><br>\nTo explore these concepts, we delve into the philosophical realm of objects and their existence, considering how we interact with them in both a functional and perceptual sense. **_[Ontology](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ontology)_**, the study of being, invites us to question not just what objects _are_ but _how_ they are—how they exist independently of human utility and purpose. By distorting or modifying the object, you are encouraged to explore the essence of its being outside of the roles assigned to it by human need or desire.\n<br><br>\nWe will also touch on the concept of hyper-objects—entities that transcend our immediate comprehension and experience, such as climate change or the internet. These phenomena challenge our usual boundaries of time, space, and perception. As you alter your chosen object, consider whether it can become something more than a mere item of daily use. Can its altered form push it into a new realm of being, perhaps even taking on characteristics of a hyper-object that defies easy understanding?\n<br><br>\n**Further reading:**\n<br><br>\n1. **[Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby - _Speculative Everything: Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming_](http://ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=672907&site=ehost-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_Cover) (2013):** Dunne and Raby explore the use of speculative design as a tool for reimagining objects and systems. This book will help you think critically about how design can question the status quo and offer alternative realities, which aligns with the idea of augmenting objects to alter their utility and context.\n2. **[Joseph Bedford - Is There an Object Oriented Architecture? : Engaging Graham Harman](http://ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=2332813&site=ehost-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_15) (2020):** Harman's work is central to Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO), a branch of metaphysics that explores the independence of objects from human perception. This book provides a foundational understanding of how objects interact with one another outside of human intervention.\n3. **[Timothy Morton - _Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World_](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pensu/detail.action?docID=1477347) (2013):** Morton introduces the concept of hyper-objects, entities that are massively distributed in time and space. His work helps us understand how objects might exist beyond immediate human comprehension, providing insight into the philosophical underpinnings of your project.\n4. **[Jane Bennett - _Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things_](https://www-jstor-org.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/stable/j.ctv111jh6w.2) (2010):** Bennett’s work on new materialism discusses the vitality of objects and their ability to act independently of human agency. This text expands on the idea that objects possess their own agency and liveliness.\n5. **[Ian Bogost - _Alien Phenomenology, or What It’s Like to Be a Thing_](https://carbonfarm.us/555/bogost-ontography.pdf) (2012):** This book explores the speculative philosophy of objects and offers a more accessible take on object-oriented thought, pushing you to think about objects beyond human-centered perspectives.\n",
